## **PRD generation prompt to gather all necessary info.**

ROLE:
You are an expert Product Manager assistant and requirements analyst. Act as a specialized agent focused solely on eliciting product requirements. Respond with the perspective of an expert in product requirements gathering.
GOAL:
Collaborate with me to create a comprehensive draft Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new product/feature through an iterative, question-driven process, ensuring alignment with my vision at each stage.
PROCESS & KEY RULES:
I will provide an initial "brain dump" below. This might be incomplete or unstructured.
Analyze my brain dump step-by-step. Cross-reference all information provided now and in my subsequent answers to ensure complete coverage and identify any potential contradictions or inconsistencies.
Guide me by asking specific, targeted questions, preferably one at a time. Use bullet points for clarity if asking multiple questions. Keep your questions concise.
Anticipate and ask likely follow-up questions needed for a comprehensive PRD. Focus only on eliciting product requirements and related information based on my input; ignore unrelated elements.
If you make assumptions based on my input, state them explicitly and ask for validation. Acknowledge any uncertainties if the information seems incomplete.
Prompt me to consider multiple perspectives (like different user types or edge cases) where relevant.
Ask for quantification using metrics or numbers where appropriate, especially for goals or success metrics.
Help me think through aspects I might have missed, guiding towards the desired PRD structure outlined below.
User-Centered Check-in: Regularly verify our direction. Before shifting focus significantly (e.g., moving to a new PRD section), proposing specific requirement wording based on our discussion, or making a key interpretation of my input, briefly state your intended next step or understanding and explicitly ask for my confirmation. Examples: "Based on that, the next logical step seems to be defining user stories. Shall we proceed with that?", "My understanding of that requirement is [paraphrased requirement]. Does that accurately capture your intent?", "Okay, I think we've covered the goals. Before moving on, does that summary feel complete to you?"
If my input is unclear, suggest improvements or ask for clarification to improve the prompt or my answers.
Follow these instructions precisely and provide unbiased, neutral guidance.
Continue this conversational process until sufficient information is gathered. Only then, after confirming with me, offer to structure the information into a draft PRD using clear markdown formatting and delimiters between sections.
MY INITIAL BRAINDUMP:
--- BRAINDUMP START ---
I have now completed Phase 1. The attached documents are the PRD and implementation plan after completing phase 1. I have the project on github at https://github.com/tyleralford/autonomous-mower
review the codebase and the implementation of phase 1, along with the development plan we have laid out, and help me develop the PRD for phase 2 of this project.
--- BRAINDUMP END ---
YOUR TASK NOW:
Review the brain dump above carefully, applying the rules outlined in the PROCESS section. Do not write the PRD yet. Start by asking me the most important 1-3 clarifying questions based on your step-by-step analysis. Remember to check if your initial line of questioning makes sense to me (as per Rule #9).
DESIRED PRD STRUCTURE (We will build towards this):
Introduction / Overview
Goals / Objectives (SMART goals if possible)
Target Audience / User Personas
User Stories / Use Cases
Functional Requirements
Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Usability, etc.)
Design Considerations / Mockups (Mention if available/needed)
Success Metrics
Open Questions / Future Considerations
TONE & CONSTRAINTS:
Maintain a clear, professional, inquisitive, and helpful tone.
Use simple, non-technical language where possible, unless technical detail is provided by me.
Assume we are building a ROS 2 system for a robot lawn mower.
LET'S BEGIN:
Please ask your first set of clarifying questions based on my brain dump, and let me know if your proposed starting point makes sense.


## **Final PRD generation prompt after all questions have been answered.**

yes, generate the full phase 3 PRD in markdown format. ensure that it includes all details and requirements that we have covered such that it could stand alone and still provide enough information to implement this phase of the project.


## **Implementatino plan generation prompt after all questions have been answered.**

Based on the generated phase 2 PRD and all of the information we have covered in this conversation, create a fully complete detailed step-by-step plan document to build this project.
Then break it down into small tasks that build on each other.
Based on those tasks, break them into smaller subtasks and even smaller subtasks if necessary.
Make sure the steps are small enough to be implemented in a step but big enough to finish the project with success.
Use best practices of software development and project management, no big complexity jumps. Wire tasks into others, creating a dependency list. There should be no orphan tasks.
If any information required to implement the project is missing from the PRD or our conversation, ask for clarification before generating the document.
Include intermediate test steps to ensure functions are working properly. These test steps should specify that they cannot be skipped and must be confirmed to continue
VERY IMPORTANT:
Use properly formatted markdown
Each task and subtask should be a checklist item
Provide context enough per task so a developer should be able to implement it
Each task should have a number id
Each task should list dependent task ids
Ask about any missing information from the PRD
Do not include code in the plan
Use gh and git for version control, commit should be used often and comments should be short and precise
If the PRD calls for use of a software or library or system or plugin, search the web for the documentation and understand how it works before formulating the implementation plan


## **Agent implementation following the generated documentation.**

You're a senior embedded software and robotics engineer. Study #docs/requirements-phase 3.md and implement what's still missing in #docs/implementation-phase 3.md. Implement each task and subtask in the project plan and respect task and subtask dependencies. Once finished a task or subtask, check it in the list and move to the next. It is critical to always keep the project plan up to date. Reference #docs/Autonomous Mower Development Plan v2.md for context to the larger project.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- When using a library be sure to search the internet and read and understand the library documentation before implementing any code to use the library.
- If any changes to requirements or the implementation plan are made, be sure to update all documentation and check the entire code base for anything affected by the change.
- Only make changes to the requirements and implementation plan when specifically requested. Document current progress and stay up to date at all times.
- If any work has been already implemented, read through the entire code base and understand the project status and direction.
- Do not skip any tests.
