## **Autonomous Mower: Phase 1 Implementation Plan**

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step plan for executing Phase 1 of the Autonomous Mower project. It is designed to be followed sequentially by a developer. Each task builds upon the previous one, with mandatory testing checkpoints to ensure system integrity at every stage.

### **Module 1: Robot Description (`mower_description`)**

This module focuses on creating the robot's digital twin using a modular URDF/XACRO approach. We will build the robot model component-by-component, with each logical subsystem in its own file for better maintainability, reusability, and clarity. The modular structure provides the following benefits:

- **Maintainability:** Each component can be modified independently without affecting others
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused in different robot configurations
- **Clarity:** Logical separation makes the model easier to understand and debug
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
- **Modularity:** Easy to add or remove components for different robot variants

**Modular Structure:**
- `mower.urdf.xacro` - Main assembly file that includes all components
- `components/materials.xacro` - Material definitions and colors
- `components/chassis.xacro` - Base link, chassis, and counterweight
- `components/wheels.xacro` - Drive wheels and their joints
- `components/cutting_system.xacro` - Reel, front roller, and motor components
