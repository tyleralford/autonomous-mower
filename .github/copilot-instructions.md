# General Code Guidelines Copilot Instructions

- Make changes file by file and allow for review of mistakes.
- Never use apologies or give feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes or summarize changes made.
- Only implement changes explicitly requested; do not invent changes.
- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities; preserve existing structures.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file, not in multiple steps.
- Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names for readability.
- Adhere to the existing coding style in the project.
- Prioritize code performance and security in suggestions.
- Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
- Encourage modular design for maintainability and reusability.
- Ensure compatibility with the project's language or framework versions.
- Replace hardcoded values with named constants.
- Avoid commenting on obvious code; focus on explaining "why" and potential pitfalls.
- Write code that is readable, understandable, and maintainable.
- Use version control best practices, such as meaningful and concise commit messages.
  - For example, use comments like this: 
    - "fix(ekf): use top-level ros__parameters for node-independent configs" 
    - "docs(phase-2): mark Tests 3.A and 3.B completed; EKFs and navsat running"
    - "feat(phase-2): add GPS and IMU sensors with respective EKFs"
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
- Do not use emojis or informal language in code comments, documentation, or commit messages.
- If a process is running in a terminal, do not run another command in that terminal until the process is finished.
  - If you need to run multiple commands, open a new terminal for each command.
