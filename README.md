# Autonomous Mower Project

This repository contains the ROS 2 software stack for an autonomous mower robot.

## Phase 1: Foundational Simulation and Manual Control

Phase 1 focuses on creating a high-fidelity digital twin of the mower within a simulated environment for development and testing.

## Getting Started

Instructions will be added as the project develops.
